This code outlines the steps for building, training, and visualizing a neural network model using Keras and Pandas, with a focus on binary classification.

Code Explanation

1. Importing Libraries:

pandas is imported to handle data loading and manipulation.

Sequential and Dense from Keras are imported to create a feed-forward neural network (ANN).



2. Data Loading:

df = pd.read_csv('5.csv')

Loads data from a CSV file named 5.csv into a Pandas DataFrame.



3. Data Inspection:

df.info() provides a summary of the DataFrame, including data types, non-null counts, and memory usage.

df.columns returns the column names in the DataFrame.



4. Preparing Features and Target:

x = df.iloc[:, 0:-1].values extracts the feature matrix (all columns except the last one).

y = df.iloc[:, 8].values extracts the target variable from the ninth column.



5. Creating the Neural Network Model:

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

A Sequential model is initialized and layers are added:

Input layer with 12 neurons, expecting 8 features, and using ReLU activation.

Hidden layer with 8 neurons, using ReLU activation.

Output layer with 1 neuron, using sigmoid activation (suitable for binary classification).




6. Compiling and Training the Model:

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x, y, epochs=100, batch_size=10)

The model is compiled with:

binary_crossentropy loss function (for binary classification).

adam optimizer, commonly used for neural networks.

accuracy metric.


model.fit trains the model on the data for 100 epochs with a batch size of 10.



7. Model Evaluation:

_, accuracy = model.evaluate(x, y)
print('Accuracy:%2.f' % (accuracy * 100))

model.evaluate calculates the accuracy of the model on the training data.

The accuracy percentage is printed.



8. Model Visualization:

from ann_visualizer.visualize import ann_viz
ann_viz(model, title="My first neural network")

ann_viz from ann_visualizer is used to visualize the neural network. It creates a .gv file, which can be viewed using a compatible graph viewer.

Note: If ann_viz raises an error, there is a suggestion to save the model to a file (model.h5) and visualize it with netron.



9. Model Prediction:

predictions = np.round_(model.predict(x))
print(predictions)

The model predicts classes for the training data, rounding predictions to 0 or 1 (since it's binary classification).

Predictions are printed.



10. Model Summary:

model.summary()

Displays a summary of the model architecture, showing each layerâ€™s name, type, output shape, and the number of parameters. This helps in understanding the model structure and parameter count.
