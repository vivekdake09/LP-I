5. Assignment on Multilayer Neural Network Model
a. Load the dataset in the program. Define the ANN Model with Keras. Define at least two hidden layers. Specify the ReLU function as activation function for the hidden layer and Sigmoid for the output layer.
b. Compile the model with necessary parameters. Set the number of epochs and batch size and fit the model
c. Evaluate the performance of the model for different values of epochs and batch sizes.
d. Evaluate model performance using different activation functions Visualize the model using ANN Visualizer
The dataset is has total 9 attributes where the last attribute is "Class attribute" having values 0 and 1. (1 "Positive for Diabetes", 0-"Negative")
