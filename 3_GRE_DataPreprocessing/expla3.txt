1. What types of Classification Algorithms do you know?
Classification algorithms are used to categorize data into predefined classes or labels. Common types of classification algorithms include:
•	Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary classification problems.
•	Decision Trees: A tree-like model used for making decisions based on feature values.
•	Random Forest: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
•	Support Vector Machines (SVM): A method that finds a hyperplane to separate data points of different classes.
•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method that classifies data points based on the majority class among the k-nearest data points.
•	Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.
•	Neural Networks: Deep learning models used for complex classification tasks with multiple layers of neurons.
2. What are Decision Trees?
•	Decision Trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. The model predicts the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
•	A Decision Tree splits the data into smaller subsets based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure of decision nodes and leaf nodes.
•	Each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents an output class (label).
3. What type of node is considered Pure?
•	A node is considered Pure when all the data points in that node belong to the same class.
•	In other words, if a node has samples of only one class (e.g., all 1's or all 0's), it is pure. This means the impurity or entropy of that node is zero.
4. How are the different nodes of Decision Trees represented?
•	Root Node: The top-most node in a decision tree. It represents the entire dataset and is split based on the best feature.
•	Decision Nodes: Internal nodes that represent decisions made based on feature values. These nodes split the data further into branches.
•	Leaf Nodes (Terminal Nodes): The end nodes of the decision tree that provide the final classification label. They represent the class labels (output) based on the splits made from the root to the leaf.
5. What are some advantages of using Decision Trees?
•	Easy to Interpret and Understand: Decision trees provide a clear and visual representation of the decision-making process.
•	Handles Non-Linear Relationships: They can capture complex non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.
•	Requires Little Data Preprocessing: Decision trees do not require feature scaling or normalization, and they can handle both numerical and categorical data.
•	Feature Importance: Decision trees help identify the most important features for prediction by analyzing the splits.
6. What is Gini Index and how is it used in Decision Trees?
•	The Gini Index is a metric used to measure the impurity of a node in a decision tree. It represents the probability of a randomly chosen element being incorrectly classified if it was randomly labeled according to the distribution of classes in the node.
•	Formula for Gini Index:
Gini Index=1−∑i=1npi2\text{Gini Index} = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2Gini Index=1−i=1∑npi2
Where pip_ipi is the probability of an element belonging to class iii.
•	Usage in Decision Trees:
o	At each split in the decision tree, the algorithm evaluates the Gini index for each possible split to decide the best feature to split on.
o	The feature with the lowest Gini index is chosen, as it represents the purest split (lowest impurity).
o	In the provided code, the criterion="entropy" was used instead of Gini index, meaning Information Gain was the metric used. However, if criterion="gini" were specified, the Gini Index would be the measure for splitting.
Possible Oral Questions and Answers
1.	Q: What is the purpose of using train_test_split()?
o	A: It is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets, allowing us to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
2.	Q: Why do we use the DecisionTreeClassifier in this code?
o	A: The DecisionTreeClassifier is used to classify data based on decision rules derived from the features, making it suitable for binary or multi-class classification tasks.
3.	Q: What does the criterion="entropy" parameter do in the Decision Tree model?
o	A: It specifies that the model should use the entropy (information gain) method to determine the best splits at each node.
4.	Q: What is a confusion matrix?
o	A: A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It shows the counts of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
5.	Q: What are precision, recall, and F1-score in the classification_report()?
o	A:
	Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
	Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives.
	F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, used as a combined measure of accuracy.
6.	Q: What is the use of max_depth in the Decision Tree model?
o	A: The max_depth parameter limits the depth of the tree to prevent overfitting and control the complexity of the model.
7.	Q: Why do we remove the 'Serial No.' column from the dataset?
o	A: The 'Serial No.' column is not a predictive feature and does not affect the outcome, so it is removed to avoid unnecessary noise in the model.
8.	Q: What does an accuracy score of 1 mean?
o	A: An accuracy score of 1 indicates a perfect prediction, where all test samples are correctly classified.
