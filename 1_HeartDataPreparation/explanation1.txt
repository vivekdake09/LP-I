General Data Preprocessing Questions:
1.	What are the 5 major steps of data preprocessing?
o	Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates.
o	Data Integration: Combining data from multiple sources.
o	Data Transformation: Normalizing and scaling data.
o	Data Reduction: Reducing the dimensionality of data.
o	Data Splitting: Dividing the data into training and testing sets.
2.	Why is data preprocessing required?
o	Data preprocessing is essential to clean and prepare raw data, ensuring it is accurate, consistent, and suitable for machine learning models. It improves model performance and reliability.
3.	What are the different techniques for data preprocessing in machine learning?
o	Techniques include handling missing values (imputation), scaling and normalization, encoding categorical data (One-Hot Encoding), feature selection, and data augmentation.
4.	What is the use of a confusion matrix in machine learning?
o	A confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by displaying the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
5.	How do you calculate precision and recall from the confusion matrix?
o	Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
o	Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
6.	How can you calculate accuracy using a confusion matrix?
o	Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / (Total Number of Samples)
What is a Confusion Matrix?
A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, particularly in binary and multi-class classification problems. It summarizes the predictions made by the model compared to the actual outcomes. The matrix helps in understanding how well the model distinguishes between different classes.
Structure of a Confusion Matrix (Binary Classification)
	Predicted: Positive (1)	Predicted: Negative (0)
Actual: Positive (1)	True Positive (TP)	False Negative (FN)
Actual: Negative (0)	False Positive (FP)	True Negative (TN)
•	True Positive (TP): The model correctly predicts a positive class (1).
•	True Negative (TN): The model correctly predicts a negative class (0).
•	False Positive (FP): The model incorrectly predicts a positive class (1) when it is actually negative (0). Also known as a Type I error.
•	False Negative (FN): The model incorrectly predicts a negative class (0) when it is actually positive (1). Also known as a Type II error.
Formulas Related to the Confusion Matrix
1.	Accuracy:
o	Measures the overall correctness of the model.
2.	Precision (Positive Predictive Value):
o	Indicates the proportion of positive predictions that were actually correct.
3.	Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):
o	Indicates the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
4.	Specificity (True Negative Rate):
o	Indicates the proportion of actual negatives that were correctly identified.
5.	F1 Score:
o	Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, balancing their values.
F1 Score=2×Precision×RecallPrecision+Recall\text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}F1 Score=2×Precision+RecallPrecision×Recall
6.	False Positive Rate (FPR):
o	Indicates the proportion of actual negatives that were incorrectly classified as positives.
False Positive Rate=FPFP+TN\text{False Positive Rate} = \frac{FP}{FP + TN}False Positive Rate=FP+TNFP
7.	False Negative Rate (FNR):
o	Indicates the proportion of actual positives that were incorrectly classified as negatives.
False Negative Rate=FNFN+TP\text{False Negative Rate} = \frac{FN}{FN + TP}False Negative Rate=FN+TPFN
8.	Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV):
o	PPV (Precision): Probability that a positive prediction is correct. PPV=TPTP+FP\text{PPV} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}PPV=TP+FPTP
o	NPV: Probability that a negative prediction is correct. NPV=TNTN+FN\text{NPV} = \frac{TN}{TN + FN}NPV=TN+FNTN
